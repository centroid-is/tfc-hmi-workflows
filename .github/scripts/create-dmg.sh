# Create a compressed DMG from a folder, retrying a "Resource busy" failure.
#
#   create-dmg.sh <volume-name> <source-folder> <output-dmg>
#
# `hdiutil create -srcfolder` attaches a temporary read/write image, copies the
# folder into it, then detaches and converts it. If anything on the runner is
# still holding that volume when it tries to detach — Spotlight/mds indexing
# the fresh mount is the usual culprit — the command dies with "Resource busy".
# Observed on PR #299, on a branch that touched only Go code, so it is not
# something a code change can provoke or avoid. The volume is left mounted, so
# a bare retry hits the same busy volume and fails identically; the stale mount
# has to be detached first, which is the whole reason this is a script and not
# a `for i in 1 2 3` around the command.
#
# Worth retrying because every caller is building a published release asset and
# every calling job sits in create-release's `needs`. By the time they run,
# retag-pubspec has already pushed the version bump and made the tag public, so
# one transient failure here leaves a live tag with no release behind it,
# recoverable only by re-running the whole workflow.
#
# After the final attempt this exits non-zero and takes the job down with it. A
# retry loop that swallowed the last error would be worse than no retry at all:
# create-release would proceed with a missing or truncated asset.
#
# Callers, keep this the only copy; two workflows drifting apart is what it
# exists to prevent:
#   .github/workflows/macos.yml     "Create DMG"
#   .github/workflows/manager.yml   "Sign and notarize macOS app bundle"
#                                   "Create unsigned DMG (when signing is not available)"
